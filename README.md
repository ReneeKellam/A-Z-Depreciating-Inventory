# Sage50-Depreciating-Inventory

Designed for use by A-Z Restaurant Equipment Company
Written by Renee Kellam

This python script takes standard outputs from Sage50/Peachtree and determines which items have been in inventory for 10+ years and can be depreciated. Requires an archived company from 10 years prior to export inventory data from and the current inventory. If you are not working for A-Z Restaurant Equipment Company and plan to use this script, please make sure to modify anything that may be different for your setup
